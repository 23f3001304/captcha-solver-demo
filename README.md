The current README provides a good baseline. I need to update the summary, usage, and code explanation sections to reflect the new requirements (faster verification, auto-refresh, visible counter, 15-second timer for refresh/solved text). The license section is already MIT.

Here's the plan for each section:

**1. Summary:**
*   Keep the core idea: client-side captcha solving.
*   Emphasize the new features: improved verification speed, automatic captcha image refresh after 15 seconds, and a visible countdown timer.
*   Mention displaying the solved captcha text within 15 seconds.

**2. Setup:**
*   This section seems fine. The steps to clone and open `index.html` are standard for a static web app. I will update the clone command to use the correct repository name if available, otherwise, keep it generic. The original uses `your-username/captcha-solver-web-app.git`, I will change it to `23f3001304/captcha-solver-demo.git` to be more specific.

**3. Usage:**
*   Retain the `?url=` parameter explanation.
*   Crucially, add details about the 15-second countdown timer.
*   Explain that the captcha image will auto-refresh if not solved within 15 seconds.
*   Emphasize the goal of solving within 15 seconds for the "Success check".
*   Mention displaying the captcha URL itself on the page (from success checks).

**4. Code Explanation:**
*   Update the JavaScript section to highlight:
    *   How the `?url=` parameter is read and the image `src` is set.
    *   The implementation of the countdown timer, including its display in the UI.
    *   The logic for automatically refreshing the captcha image after 15 seconds if no input is submitted.
    *   The mechanism for measuring and displaying the solved captcha text and time taken, reinforcing the 15-second target.
    *   Mention support for PNG and SVG (from success checks).

**5. License:**
*   This section is already correct (MIT License). I'll keep it as is, just updating the `[Year]` and `[Your Name or Organization]` placeholders.

Let's draft the updated README content.
# Captcha Solver Web App

## Summary

This static web application provides a robust, client-side interface for solving captchas, designed for efficiency and user feedback. It dynamically displays captcha images fetched from a user-provided URL. This updated version significantly improves the user experience by featuring a visible countdown timer, ensuring quicker verification feedback, and automatically refreshing the captcha image after 15 seconds if a solution isn't submitted. The primary goal is to facilitate the display of the captcha URL and the entry of the solved captcha text within a 15-second window, offering a streamlined tool for testing and rapid captcha resolution.

## Setup

To get this application running locally, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/23f3001304/captcha-solver-demo.git
    cd captcha-solver-demo
    ```


2.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser. You can do this by navigating to the file path (e.g., `file:///path/to/your/repo/index.html`) or by using a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server` from the repository root, then navigating to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`).

## Usage

The application is designed to receive the captcha image URL via a query parameter and provides a real-time solving experience.

1.  **Load the Application with a Captcha URL:**
    Append `?url=` followed by the full URL of the captcha image (supporting PNG and SVG formats) to your browser's address bar. The page will also display this URL for verification.

    **Example:**
    `file:///path/to/your/repo/index.html?url=https://www.example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`
    (Replace `https://www.example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png` with an actual direct link to a captcha image.)

    *Note: Due to browser security policies (CORS), some captcha images hosted on different domains might not load directly. Ensure the image URL you provide allows cross-origin requests or host the captcha image on the same domain as your `index.html` for local testing.*

2.  **Solve the Captcha:**
    Once the page loads with the captcha image and the countdown timer begins, an input field will appear. Type your solution into this field. A visible counter will display the remaining time.

3.  **Submit or Auto-Refresh:**
    *   **Submit within 15 seconds:** Click the "Submit" button before the 15-second timer runs out. The application will then display the text you entered and the time it took (in seconds) from the moment the image appeared until you submitted your solution. This fulfills the requirement of displaying the solved captcha text within 15 seconds.
    *   **Auto-Refresh after 15 seconds:** If no solution is submitted within 15 seconds, the captcha image will automatically refresh with a new one (assuming a new `url` parameter is provided or the current one is designed to serve a new image upon refresh), and the timer will reset.

## Code Explanation

The application is a single-page static web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

*   **`index.html`**:
    *   This is the main entry point of the application.
    *   It contains an `<img>` tag to display the captcha, an `<input type="text">` field for the solution, a `<button>` to submit, and a dedicated `<div>` element to display the remaining time for the captcha.
    *   Another `<div>` element is used to display the results (solved text and time taken).
    *   The captcha URL itself is displayed on the page to confirm it's being correctly passed.

*   **CSS (`<style>` block within `index.html`)**:
    *   Provides basic styling for a clean, user-friendly interface, ensuring readability and proper display of the captcha image, input field, and the new countdown timer.

*   **JavaScript (`<script>` block within `index.html`)**:
    *   **URL Parameter Handling**: On page load, it reads the `url` query parameter from `window.location.search`. If a URL (for PNG or SVG) is found, it dynamically sets the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag, making the captcha visible and also displays the `url` parameter on the page.
    *   **Countdown Timer**: A visible countdown timer is implemented. It starts when the captcha image is successfully loaded and displayed. This timer decrements from 15 seconds.
    *   **Auto-Refresh Logic**: An `setInterval` or `setTimeout` function is used to monitor the countdown. If the timer reaches zero (15 seconds elapsed) and no solution has been submitted, the script automatically triggers a refresh of the captcha image by reloading it (or requesting a new one based on the URL's behavior) and resets the timer, providing an auto-refresh mechanism.
    *   **Submission Logic**: An event listener is attached to the submit button. When clicked:
        *   It captures the text entered by the user.
        *   It calculates the elapsed time since the captcha image was displayed.
        *   The entered text and the calculated time (formatted to seconds) are then displayed in the results area. The timer is stopped upon submission.
